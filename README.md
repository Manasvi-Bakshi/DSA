# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Answers to LeetCode

This repositary contains my answers to Data Structure and Algorithm problems which is linked to my LeetCode. It's a way for me to keep track of my progress, go over how I solve problems, and keep my code neat.

Most of the solutions are written in Python while some of them are in C++. The name of each file is the title or number of the problem, and there are usually short comments to give it context.
To update this repositary I used the chrome extension [LeetSync](https://github.com/LeetSync/LeetSync) so special thanks to them for making such a useful extension
